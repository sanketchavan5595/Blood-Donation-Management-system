## Blood Donation Management System 

### Description 
The purpose of this mini-project was to 
study blood donation systems and how they work and 
also to come up with a solution which will help manage 
blood donation and make sure that blood requirements of 
the patients are fulfilled. 
This system will allow users to know:
* which patients need blood and their blood types?
* Which blood banks are there near their location? 
* How people have donated blood?
* When to plan the next blood donation campaign?

All the constraints have been properly applied to ensure the integrity of the data.
